							<h2>An Artist Since When?</h2>
								<p>I have been an artist since the 60's. Yeah it was a very long time ago.</p><img src="pepperWeddingSillyFrame250.jpg">

							<h2>The Inspiration in Life?</h2>
								It all started with a tiny drawing of a spotted pony. My mother answered my request to give me a pony. We didn't have a really big back yard..we lived in the suburbs. Instead, she took 10 minutes and drew a very realistic sketch of the most beautiful pony I'd ever seen.
								It took her such a short time and it came out of nowhere...I was bitten by the bug....I had to learn how to do this too!</article>

							<h2>Learning All the Time?</h2>
								Looking, listening and learning...all the time. That is how we stay inspired. We are open to anything. We never say no.Always be ready to jump in. Creativity is the only real adventure because you never know what will happen and you never have to go anywhere. The adventure is in your head.
